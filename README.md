- Easy customization of the passcode, allowing for quick changes.
- Automatic alert initiation or user contact upon incorrect passcode entry to report unauthorized access.
- Audible signal for successful unlocking confirmation.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Connect the devices and components according to the specified connections in the code.
2. Upload the provided code to your Arduino board.
3. Upon system startup, the LCD screen will display the message "Enter your pass."
4. Use the keypad to enter the designated passcode.
5. If the correct passcode is entered, the screen will display "Done," and the lock will open.
6. In the case of an incorrect passcode entry, the system will trigger an alert or contact you to notify of unauthorized access.
